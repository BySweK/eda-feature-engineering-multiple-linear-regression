# EDA & Multiple Linear Regression Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and multiple linear regression on a numerical dataset to understand the factors affecting price.

The goal is to build an interpretable regression model and evaluate its performance using standard machine learning practices.
